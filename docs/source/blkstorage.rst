Block Storage Enhancements
==========================

Block Storage was originally implemented with a FileSystem storage using
indexes stored in LevelDB. This filesystem storage is not scalable and
requires a separate storage for the indexes. The new storage used in this
mod project is CouchDB.

CouchDB
-------

There are several benefits for using CouchDB storage for blocks, among these
are:
   - The use of a distributed and scalable storage between peers.
   - Indexes are managed in the same storage.
