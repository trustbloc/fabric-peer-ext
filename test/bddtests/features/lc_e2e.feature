Feature:
  Background: Setup
    Given the channel "mychannel" is created and all peers have joined

  @lc_e2e_s1
  Scenario: e2e
    And collection config "privColl" is defined for collection "collection3" as policy="OR('Org1MSP.member','Org2MSP.member')", requiredPeerCount=1, maxPeerCount=2, and blocksToLive=3

    And we wait 3 seconds

    And peer "peer0.org1.example.com" is queried for installed chaincodes
    And the JSON path "#.packageID" of the response does not contain "${e2ePackageID}"

    And chaincode "e2e_cc" is installed from path "fixtures/testdata/chaincode/e2e_cc" to all peers
    And the response is saved to variable "e2ePackageID"

    And peer "peer0.org1.example.com" is queried for installed chaincodes
    And the JSON path "#.label" of the response contains "e2e_cc"
    And the JSON path "#.packageID" of the response contains "${e2ePackageID}"

    And peer "peer1.org1.example.com" is queried for installed chaincodes
    And the JSON path "#.label" of the response contains "e2e_cc"
    And the JSON path "#.packageID" of the response contains "${e2ePackageID}"

    And peer "peer0.org2.example.com" is queried for installed chaincodes
    And the JSON path "#.label" of the response contains "e2e_cc"
    And the JSON path "#.packageID" of the response contains "${e2ePackageID}"

    And peer "peer1.org2.example.com" is queried for installed chaincodes
    And the JSON path "#.label" of the response contains "e2e_cc"
    And the JSON path "#.packageID" of the response contains "${e2ePackageID}"

    And chaincode "e2e_cc", version "v1", sequence 1 is checked for readiness by orgs "peerorg1,peerorg2" on the "mychannel" channel with endorsement policy "AND('Org1MSP.member','Org2MSP.member')" and collection policy "privColl"
    And the JSON path "Org1MSP" of the boolean response equals "false"
    And the JSON path "Org2MSP" of the boolean response equals "false"

    And chaincode "e2e_cc", version "v1", package ID "${e2ePackageID}", sequence 1 is approved by orgs "peerorg1" on the "mychannel" channel with endorsement policy "AND('Org1MSP.member','Org2MSP.member')" and collection policy "privColl"
    Then we wait 5 seconds

    And chaincode "e2e_cc", version "v1", sequence 1 is checked for readiness by orgs "peerorg1" on the "mychannel" channel with endorsement policy "AND('Org1MSP.member','Org2MSP.member')" and collection policy "privColl"
    And the JSON path "Org1MSP" of the boolean response equals "true"
    And the JSON path "Org2MSP" of the boolean response equals "false"

    And chaincode "e2e_cc", version "v1", package ID "${e2ePackageID}", sequence 1 is approved by orgs "peerorg2" on the "mychannel" channel with endorsement policy "AND('Org1MSP.member','Org2MSP.member')" and collection policy "privColl"
    Then we wait 5 seconds

    And chaincode "e2e_cc", version "v1", sequence 1 is checked for readiness by orgs "peerorg1" on the "mychannel" channel with endorsement policy "AND('Org1MSP.member','Org2MSP.member')" and collection policy "privColl"
    And the JSON path "Org1MSP" of the boolean response equals "true"
    And the JSON path "Org2MSP" of the boolean response equals "true"

    Then chaincode "e2e_cc", version "v1", sequence 1 is committed by orgs "peerorg1,peerorg2" on the "mychannel" channel with endorsement policy "AND('Org1MSP.member','Org2MSP.member')" and collection policy "privColl"
    Then we wait 5 seconds

    And committed chaincode "e2e_cc" is queried by orgs "peerorg1,peerorg2" on the "mychannel" channel
    And the JSON path "#" of the response has 1 items
    And the JSON path "0.name" of the response equals "e2e_cc"
    And the JSON path "0.version" of the response equals "v1"
    And the JSON path "0.approvals.Org1MSP" of the boolean response equals "true"
    And the JSON path "0.approvals.Org2MSP" of the boolean response equals "true"

    And all committed chaincodes are queried by orgs "peerorg1,peerorg2" on the "mychannel" channel
    And the JSON path "#.name" of the response contains "e2e_cc"

    Then peer "peer0.org1.example.com" is queried for approved chaincode "e2e_cc" and sequence 1 on the "mychannel" channel
    And the JSON path "name" of the response equals "e2e_cc"
    And the JSON path "version" of the response equals "v1"
    And the JSON path "packageID" of the response equals "${e2ePackageID}"

    And chaincode "e2e_cc" is warmed up on all peers on the "mychannel" channel

    # We need to wait a while so that all of the peers' channel membership is Gossip'ed to all other peers.
    Then we wait 20 seconds

    # Perform a rolling restart of all peers to ensure that the user chaincodes are re-registered
    Given container "peer0.org1.example.com" is stopped
    And container "peer0.org1.example.com" is started
    Then we wait 5 seconds

    Then container "peer1.org1.example.com" is stopped
    And container "peer1.org1.example.com" is started
    Then we wait 5 seconds

    Then container "peer0.org2.example.com" is stopped
    And container "peer0.org2.example.com" is started
    Then we wait 5 seconds

    Then container "peer1.org2.example.com" is stopped
    And container "peer1.org2.example.com" is started
    Then we wait 5 seconds
