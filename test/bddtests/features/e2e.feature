Feature:
  Background: Setup
    Given the channel "mychannel" is created and all peers have joined
    And collection config "privColl" is defined for collection "collection3" as policy="OR('Org1MSP.member','Org2MSP.member')", requiredPeerCount=1, maxPeerCount=2, and blocksToLive=3
    And "test" chaincode "e2e_cc" is installed from path "github.com/trustbloc/fabric-peer-ext/test/chaincode/e2e_cc" to all peers
    And "test" chaincode "e2e_cc" is instantiated from path "github.com/trustbloc/fabric-peer-ext/test/chaincode/e2e_cc" on the "mychannel" channel with args "" with endorsement policy "AND('Org1MSP.member','Org2MSP.member')" with collection policy "privColl"
    And chaincode "e2e_cc" is warmed up on all peers on the "mychannel" channel

    # We need to wait a while so that all of the peers' channel membership is Gossip'ed to all other peers.
    Then we wait 20 seconds

  Scenario: e2e
    # Perform a rolling restart of all peers to ensure that the user chaincodes are re-registered
    Given container "peer0.org1.example.com" is stopped
    And container "peer0.org1.example.com" is started
    Then we wait 5 seconds

    Then container "peer1.org1.example.com" is stopped
    And container "peer1.org1.example.com" is started
    Then we wait 5 seconds

    Then container "peer0.org2.example.com" is stopped
    And container "peer0.org2.example.com" is started
    Then we wait 5 seconds

    Then container "peer1.org2.example.com" is stopped
    And container "peer1.org2.example.com" is started
    Then we wait 5 seconds

  Scenario: Auth filter test
    # In this test the example Auth filter intercepts the request and returns an error with a message that includes the channel peer endpoints
    When client queries chaincode "e2e_cc" with args "authFilterError" on the "mychannel" channel then the error response should contain "Peers in channel [mychannel]"
