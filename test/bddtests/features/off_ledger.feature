  Background: Setup
    Given the channel "mychannel" is created and all peers have joined
    And the channel "yourchannel" is created and all peers have joined

    And off-ledger collection config "ol_coll1" is defined for collection "collection1" as policy="OR('Org1MSP.member','Org2MSP.member')", requiredPeerCount=1, maxPeerCount=2, and timeToLive=10s
    And DCAS collection config "dcas_coll2" is defined for collection "collection2" as policy="OR('Org1MSP.member','Org2MSP.member')", requiredPeerCount=1, maxPeerCount=2, and timeToLive=10m
    And collection config "coll3" is defined for collection "collection3" as policy="OR('Org1MSP.member','Org2MSP.member')", requiredPeerCount=1, maxPeerCount=2, and blocksToLive=10
    And DCAS collection config "dcas_accounts" is defined for collection "accounts" as policy="OR('Org1MSP.member','Org2MSP.member')", requiredPeerCount=1, maxPeerCount=3, and timeToLive=30m
    And "test" chaincode "ol_examplecc" is installed from path "github.com/trustbloc/e2e_cc" to all peers
    And "test" chaincode "ol_examplecc" is instantiated from path "github.com/trustbloc/e2e_cc" on the "mychannel" channel with args "" with endorsement policy "AND('Org1MSP.member','Org2MSP.member')" with collection policy "ol_coll1,dcas_coll2,coll3,dcas_accounts"
    And chaincode "ol_examplecc" is warmed up on all peers on the "mychannel" channel

  Scenario: Put and get off-ledger data
    # Test for invalid CAS key
    When client queries chaincode "ol_examplecc" with args "putprivate,collection2,key1,value1" on the "mychannel" channel then the error response should contain "the key should be the hash of the value"

    # Set off-ledger data on a peer in one org and get it from one in another org
    When client queries chaincode "ol_examplecc" with args "putprivate,collection1,key1,value1" on a single peer in the "peerorg1" org on the "mychannel" channel

    And client queries chaincode "ol_examplecc" with args "getprivate,collection2,${key2}" on a single peer in the "peerorg2" org on the "mychannel" channel
    Then response from "ol_examplecc" to client equal value "value2"

    # Test for put of keys on multiple collections. The first two collections are off-ledger/DCAS type so they should persist. The third
    # is a private data collection, so the data should not persist.
    Given variable "casKeyY" is assigned the CAS key of value "valY"
    When client queries chaincode "ol_examplecc" with args "putprivatemultiple,collection1,keyX,valX,collection2,${casKeyY},valY,collection3,keyZ,valZ" on the "mychannel" channel

    Then response from "ol_examplecc" to client equal value "valX,valY,"

    # Test for the case where get data should not return data that was stored in the current transaction.
    # When multiple peers are involved in an endorsement then one endorser may already have propagated the private
    # data to another endorser. The first endorser will think that there is no value for a given key but the second
    # endorser will find the value that was provided by the first. In this case, the current transaction ID is compared
    # with the transaction ID at which the data was stored. If the IDs match then nil is returned.

    Given variable "pvtKey2" is assigned the CAS key of value "pvtVal2"
    When client invokes chaincode "ol_examplecc" with args "putprivatemultiple,collection1,pvtKey1,pvtVal1,collection2,${pvtKey2},pvtVal2,collection3,pvtKey3,pvtVal3" on the "mychannel" channel
